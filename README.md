# ComputerVision
This repository is for learning computer vision, using mainly OpenCV 4.2.0 and Python 3.6

Current functionality:
  - The source.py loads the fruit.jpg
  - Image is pre-processed and thresholded
  - Features of white areas (fruit) are extracted
  - Based on these features, the fruit is classified
  - The fruit is labeled by highlighting its contours with a specific colour.

TODO:
  - class Fruit 
    - storing the features of the fruit object
    - doing the classification based on the features
    
  - user control of some paramters in real time with image refreshing
  - labeling with captions, not just contours
  - ability to handle database of images
  - ability to store labels and image path in a database (SQL?)
 
EXPERIMENT WITH:
  - CUDA
  - ROS
  - TensorFlow Machine Leaning
  - build my own machimne learning algorithm
